# Maria Hola - First To Do List
made as a homework project during the YouCode course for a Frontend Developer carrier.

## First time making a project where I combined: 
* extensive JavaScript code so far 
* adding content by user 
* button with an icon

## Demo

------

### How it works? 
##### The placeholder is made to insert the task.
##### Below you see all tasks you need to do. 
##### Left button crosses out the completed task.
##### The right button removes the task from the list. 

### Project in a nutshell: 
* HTML, BEM convention, Normalize.css, JavaScript, CSS
* minimalistic design 
* super easy-to-use to do list
